# cocos-runtime-bin

This repository is to create a runtime for Code IDE, to allow developers connect their Cocos Code IDE to this runtime/simulator, and debug lua code in it.
But since the Cocos Code IDE project has been on hold, the reposiroty have no use unless we reopen Code IDE project someday.
